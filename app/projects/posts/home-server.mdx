summary: 'What I run from my garage'
---

I have been running some server or another from my garage for nearly the past ten years at this point. 

It started out as mostly hosting game servers for my friends, but during the pandemic I got into both
home automation and hosting a wider stacsk of server applications and it has grown since then.

There are four main "servers"
- Home Management Server
- Remote Media / Game Server
- TrueNAS Scale Storage Server
- Synology NAS
