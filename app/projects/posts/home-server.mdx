## Introduction

I have been running some server or another from my garage for nearly the past ten years at this point. 

It started out as mostly hosting game servers for my friends, but during the pandemic I got into both
home automation and hosting a wider stack of server applications and it has grown since then.

There are two main "servers" and two storage servers
- Home Management Server
- Application ( Game / Media) Server
- TrueNAS Scale Storage Server
- Synology NAS

Here is a brief explanation of the role and what I have set up on each server.
I may make these more tutorial style in the future.
