### Introduction

Since I started work on my server I found that a lot of the functionality I add to
my server would also be very helpful for the more general minecraft community, and
I feel its my part to give back for all the plugins I have gotten over the years.

I have published a few plugins so far, and hope to do more as time goes on.

## Celerity

This plugin allows players to connect to the closest server based on their geographic location. By simply entering myserver.com, players are automatically redirected to the nearest server without the need for proxying their connection.

Example Scenario:

Server A (east.myserver.com) located in New York.

Server B (west.myserver.com) located in Los Angeles.

Players who connect through myserver.com will be redirected to either Server A or Server B, depending on which is geographically closer.

## World Delete Plugin

This was my first plugin, and is pretty simple. It deletes worlds after every restart for minigame servers.
