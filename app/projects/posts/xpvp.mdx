## Introduction

I have always had fun setting up and running servers for various games and services,
but this project is one of the first I have developed most of the software stack for.

The goal when making this project was to create a fun and competitive minecraft server
that isn't based around microtransactions and has a clear path for players to see and
track themselves improve. It started from working from the ideas left behind by the old
mcpvp server and trying to modernize it for the current minecraft playerbase.


## Features

- Elo based ranking systems
- Player rewards
- Kits suited to different playstyles
- Website showing player progression and statistics

## Structure

This is a very general overview of the stack for the service:

![flowchart](/images/xpvp/xpvp-flowchart.svg)

When a player connects they are sent to the lobby server where they can
choose to queue for a game mode.

When the player enters the queue the lobby server has a matchmaking coordinator that uses their
personal statistics from the database to find them a match. 

Once a match is found the lobby tells the proxy to send them to game server and
when the game is concluded the match and player
data is sent to a SQL database allowing players to view matches and stats online.

## Plugins

Plugins are the term for the software that hooks into the server API, in
my case Paper's API allowing you to create custom content without having 
to rewrite or use reflection on Mojang's provided server jar.

#### Queue Plugin

#### Lobby Plugin


The XPVP minecraft server is still very much a work in progress.
