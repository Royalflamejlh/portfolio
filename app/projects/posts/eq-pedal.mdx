# Tweaker EQ Pedal

## Introduction

![Schematic](/images/eq/eq.svg)

This project's goal started by just looking around to see what type of guitar pedal would be easily resonable to build, but still pose some challenges. 
While looking we found the schematic of the [Rock Bottom EQ](https://www.diyguitarpedals.com.au/shop/boms/Rock%20Bottom%20EQ.pdf) and adapted it into our own
iteration in KiCad. The first order of PCB's were found to have some issues with the power system we ended up using for the board, which will be updated 
in our next design.

## Current Status

As of right now the first prototype of the pedal has been tested and we found some pretty big grounding problems, along with instability in the power supply circuity.

## Future Plans

There are a list of changes slated for the next prototype, as of right now they are:
- New power system
- Screw holes for mounting
- An enclosure for the pedal
- Redisgned grounding system
- More equalizer levels
