# T EQ Pedal

## Introduction

This project's goal is to just make a simple home made equalizer pedal for a standard guitar.

The project started work from schematic of the [Rock Bottom EQ](https://www.diyguitarpedals.com.au/shop/boms/Rock%20Bottom%20EQ.pdf) and adapted it into our own schematic.

## Current Status

As of right now the first prototype of the pedal has been tested and we found some pretty big grounding problems, along with instability in the power supply circuity.

## Editing

The project can be opened and edited in KiCad 8
