# ECE445 Watt Balance Project

![Watt Balance](/images/wattbalance/balance.jpeg)

## Introduction
This project was my senior design project for the University of Illinois. My group decided on making a [Kibble Balance](https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/kilogram-kibble-balance) which is
a scale that can measure mass based on the new [2019 definition of a kilogram.](https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/2019_redefinition_of_the_SI_base_units)

## Features
- **Custom 3D Printed Balance**: Designed for precise measurements.
- **Custom PCB**: For accurate measurement and control.
- **Velocity Mode**: Calculates the coil constant.
- **Force Mode**: Uses the coil constant to measure mass accurately.
- **Manual Estimation**: Allows for accurate mass readings.
